# 🌍 Global Health Insights with Tableau
This project uses Tableau to visually explore global health data, focusing on life expectancy, cancer rates, and BMI. The goal is to uncover patterns that can inform public health strategy and policy, particularly for the UK.

# 📊 Visualisations
Global Life Expectancy Map: An animated world map showing changes in life expectancy over time. This allows users to observe global trends and regional differences from year to year.

Life Expectancy vs BMI: A line graph comparing life expectancy and BMI across continents. Each line represents a different continent, providing nuanced regional insights.

Cancer Rates by Gender: A comparative analysis of cancer incidence between men and women.

# 🔍 Key Findings
Gender and Cancer: Men were found to be more likely to develop cancer than women. This highlights the importance of targeted public health messaging towards men, who appear to be at greater risk.

BMI and Life Expectancy: Data showed that higher BMI levels were associated with increased life expectancy. However, this correlation is likely influenced by countries facing food insecurity, where low BMI may reflect malnutrition rather than healthy weight.

Implication: Policymakers, including the NHS, should avoid applying global BMI trends directly to the UK. A national-level analysis would provide more meaningful insight into how BMI impacts health outcomes locally.

Ageing Population in the UK: The UK's life expectancy is steadily increasing. This trend indicates that the NHS must prepare for the evolving needs of an ageing population, including long-term care and chronic disease management.

📌 Conclusion
This project underscores the value of interactive data visualisations in public health research. By analysing health indicators through a geographic and temporal lens, stakeholders can make more informed decisions that are responsive to both global trends and local realities.
